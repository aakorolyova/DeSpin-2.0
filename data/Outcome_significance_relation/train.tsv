The notable exception was for objectively assessed troop PA, wherein girls in intervention troops accumulated significantly less sedentary (x 2 = 6.3, p = .011), significantly more @OUTCOME$ (x 2 = 8.2, @SIGNIFICANCE$), and more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, (x 2 = 18.4, p < .001), than girls in control troops.	1
Changes in @OUTCOME$ and physical domains of quality of life were also more favorable in per protocol TC vs UC (@SIGNIFICANCE$).	1
After the 6-month treatment and 12-month follow-up, there were significant differences between the trial and control group in the following: frequency of acute exacerbation (FAS: P = 0.000; PPS: P = 0.000); duration of acute exacerbation (FAS: P = 0.000; PPS: P = 0.001); FEV1 (FAS: P = 0.007; PPS: P = 0.008); symptoms (FAS: @SIGNIFICANCE$; PPS: P = 0.001); 6MWD (FAS: P = 0.045; PPS: P = 0.042); dyspnea scale (FAS: P = 0.002; PPS: P = 0.004); and @OUTCOME$ (FAS: P = 0.000; PPS: P = 0.000), psychological domain (FAS: P = 0.008; PPS: P = 0.011), social domain (FAS: P = 0.001; PPS: P = 0.000) and environment domain (FAS: P = 0.015; PPS: P = 0.009) of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire.	0

HIV-infected children between six months and three years of age had a @SIGNIFICANCE$ higher @OUTCOME$ if they received multivitamins (n = 48; 2 cm, compared to 1 cm in the placebo group; 95% CI = 0.20, 1.70; p = 0.01; p for interaction by age group = 0.01).	1
In the comparison of @OUTCOME$, statistically @SIGNIFICANCE$ difference was also observed between pirfenidone and placebo groups.	1
Both TEF10 and @OUTCOME$ decreased @SIGNIFICANCE$ ( P < 0.05) after administration of albuterol.	1
