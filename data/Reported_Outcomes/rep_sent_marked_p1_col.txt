Discussion O
The O
aim O
of O
this O

is O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effect O
of O
group O
singing O
on O
the O
health O
related O
quality O
of O
life O
in O
older O
people O
. O

The O
two O
most O
relevant O
published O
controlled O
studies O
have O
significant O
methodological O
limitations O
, O
which O
call O
into O
question O
the O
credibility O
of O
findings O
. O

The O
proposed O
research O
should O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
step O
in O
a O
progressive O
programme O
of O
studies O
investigating O
the O
value O
of O
group O
singing O
for O

Taking O

If O
group O

proves O
to O
be O
both O

it O

Twenty O
